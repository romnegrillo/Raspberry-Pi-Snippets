# Raspberry-Pi-Snippets 

![Raspberry-Pi-Logo](/rpi_logo.png?raw=true)

### About
This repository contains snippets of code and configurations
that I use in RPi for development. This include scripts, sample
codes and configuration steps in *raspberry-pi-os* that I made so 
I won't write it again  from scratch and find the steps in the internet.
This will make my development for other projects faster since I 
will just refer to the snippets I made previously.


This does not contain complete projects but only a "snippet" 
that can be used for bigger projects in the future.
